## Project Description

Welcome to one of my first Javascript projects. This is the first project where I focused primarily on JavaScript.

This was a fun and valuable experience. I was able to put into practice everything I learned and, although it took me a while to get the flow going, once I became comfortable with the language, it all became much easier. I invite you to review my code and provide me with feedback as I am aware that I can make it better and more efficient.

The project concept and design were taken from Frontendmentor.io.

During the building process, I started with HTML and CSS, creating and styling the basic structure of the to-do app. As an added bonus, I decided to include an illustration as a placeholder when the task list was empty. I then added styles for the elements that would be added dynamically with JavaScript in the future.

The most time-consuming and fun part of the project was the JavaScript. I began with the input field at the top that added tasks. It was fun to figure out how to submit the input value when the user pressed enter on their keyboard. After that, I worked on being able to mark tasks as done when clicking the corresponding button. This was where I encountered my first challenge, but after researching, I found a solution.

Next, I had to add the ability to remove a task when clicking an "X" icon, which was relatively straightforward. I then added the ability to delete all completed tasks by checking for the "completed" class in my tasks and applying the "remove" method accordingly.

Lastly, I had to keep track of the number of active tasks and add the ability to filter the task list from all to active to completed. This was the most challenging part but, with my increased comfort level with the language, I was able to find a solution quickly.

Overall, I am pleased with the results of this project! ðŸ˜„
